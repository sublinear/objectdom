# ObjectDOM
A minimal "virtual DOM" implementation using the DocumentFragment Web API to build DOM subtrees from JavaScript objects

# Objectives
- An exploratory attempt at finding the simplest implementation of a virtual DOM.
- Is a virtual DOM implementation all the "framework" you need to build web app frontends that scale?
- Can you otherwise architect and build a web app frontend using traditional OOP design patterns and ES6 classes?
- What are possible migration paths for pre-existing JavaScript code to switch to ObjectDOM?
- How can a virtual DOM implementation complement other web technologies such as Canvas and WebAssembly?
